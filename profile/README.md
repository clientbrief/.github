# Client Brief

Client Brief is a technical simulation initiative that provides **realistic, constraint-driven briefs** designed to mirror how organizations actually make technology decisions.

All briefs published under Client Brief are **fictional but grounded in real-world patterns**, reflecting the messy, imperfect, and trade-off-heavy nature of professional engineering environments.

Client Brief is **not a collection of ideal architectures**.  
It is a collection of **decisions, constraints, and rational compromises**.

---

## What Is Client Brief?

Client Brief represents **simulated client scenarios**—organizations with:

- Budget limitations  
- Legacy systems  
- Partial cloud adoption  
- Organizational and skill constraints  
- Compliance and operational pressures  
- Non-ideal timelines and priorities  

Each brief positions the reader as an engineer, architect, or decision-maker who must respond **within those constraints**, just as they would in real professional settings.

---

## Core Philosophy

Client Brief is built on one fundamental principle:

> **Technology decisions are contextual, not absolute.**

In real organizations:
- Best practices compete with financial reality  
- Ideal architectures collide with legacy systems  
- Long-term vision is often constrained by short-term survival  

Client Brief exists to explore this reality—**without sanitizing it**.

Instead of asking:  
> *“What is the best architecture?”*

Client Brief asks:  
> *“What is the most reasonable decision given these constraints?”*

## What Client Brief Provides

Client Brief delivers structured briefs that:

- Simulate realistic client environments  
- Present incomplete or conflicting requirements  
- Expose technical, financial, and organizational trade-offs  
- Require judgment—not memorization  
- Encourage context-aware engineering decisions  

Each brief is designed to feel like a **real internal or external client engagement**, not an exam question or certification exercise.

## Domains

Client Brief is organized into focused technical domains.

### Cloud Brief
Realistic cloud architecture and operations scenarios covering:

- Cost vs reliability decisions  
- Incremental cloud adoption  
- Legacy coexistence  
- Operational trade-offs  
- Non-ideal infrastructure patterns  

> Cloud Brief is the initial focus and foundation of Client Brief.

Future domains may include:
- Platform & DevOps  
- Security & Compliance  
- Data & Analytics  
- AI & Applied ML  
- Application Architecture  

---

## Intended Audience

Client Brief is built for professionals operating **between theory and reality**, including:

- Cloud Engineers  
- Platform Engineers  
- Site Reliability Engineers (SRE)  
- Technical Leads & Architects  
- Engineering Managers  
- Senior Developers transitioning into architecture roles  

This repository assumes **professional context**, not beginner tutorials.

---

## What Client Brief Is NOT

Client Brief is **not**:

- A certification study guide  
- A vendor marketing repository  
- A collection of “best-practice-only” diagrams  
- A promise of optimal or perfect solutions  

Instead, it documents **defensible, realistic, and explainable decisions**.

---

## Why Client Brief Exists

Most technical content assumes:

- Greenfield projects  
- Unlimited or flexible budgets  
- Fully skilled teams  
- Ideal organizational alignment  

Most engineers work in:

- Brownfield systems  
- Cost-sensitive environments  
- Partial migrations  
- Imperfect teams and processes  

Client Brief exists to document the **middle ground** where real engineering happens.

---

## Disclaimer

All briefs under Client Brief are **fictional**.

- No real companies are represented  
- No real systems are disclosed  
- Scenarios are synthesized from common industry patterns  

Any resemblance to real organizations is coincidental and unintentional.
